# Webpack Starter

This is for quickly making new projects without setting up basic stuff
by hand. Was initially created in the [todo](https://github.com/ilathem/todo-top)
repo.

## Deploying:

Do all this in the main branch...

- Run `npm run build` to create the production build in dist/
- Create a commit for that release and push that to GitHub
- Run `npm run deploy` to run the git script that pushes only the dist/ folder
to the gh-pages branch, which automatically deploys to the gh-pages site.
